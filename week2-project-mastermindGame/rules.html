          The computer picks a sequence of colors. The number of colors is the
          code length.
        </li>
        <li>
          The objective of the game is to guess the exact positions of the
          colors in the computer's sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          By default, a color can be used multiple time in a code sequence. If
          you start a new game with the 'Allow duplicates' unchecked, then any
          color can be used one time in the code sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          After filling a line with your guesses and clicking on the 'Check'
          button, the computer responses with the result of your guess.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each color in your guess that is in the correct color and correct
          position in the code sequence, the computer display a small green
          color on the right side of the current guess.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each color in your guess that is in the correct color but is NOT
          in the correct position in the code sequence, the computer display a
          small yellow color on the right side of the current guess.
        </li>
        <li>
          For each color in your guess that is not the correct, the computer
          displays a nothing on the right side of the guess
        </li>
        <li>
          You win the game when you manage to guess all the colors in the code
          sequence and when they all in the right position.
        </li>

          Start a new game by clicking on the 'Start Game' button. If you wish
          to change the default game parameters, you may change the 'Allow
          duplicates' field before clicking on the 'Start Game' button.
        </li>
        <li>
          To start filling a line, you must first select a color at the top of
          the table by clicking on it. After selecting a color you can just put
          it in the current guess line.
        </li>
        <li>
          After filling a whole line, you can still change your selection before
          asking the computer to respond to your guess. When you're satisfied
          with your guess, just click on the 'Check' button and get the computer
          response.
        </li>
        <li>You have 10 attempts to guess the code sequence. Good Luck!</li>
